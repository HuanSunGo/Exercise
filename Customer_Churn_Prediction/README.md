# Bank Customer Churn Prediction
In this project, I use supervised learning models to identify customers who are likely to churn in the future. Furthermore, I will analyze top factors that influence user retention. 

## Project Overview

The goal is to understand and predict customer churn for a bank. Specifically, initially perform __*EDA*__ to identify and visualize the factors contributing to customer churn, then build up __*Supervised Machine Learning*__ models to predict whether a customer will churn or not. <br><br>
I use __*recall*__ to evaluate the model performance since correctly classifying the positive class( customers who will churn) is critical for a bank.
